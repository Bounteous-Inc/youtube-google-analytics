//To Track Thy Youtube Upon Google Analytics
//Regardless the number of Players upon thy stage
//Revised and Revisioned to Version 3
//Harken version 3 was written during the Polar Vortex
//Which Struck our fair city lo in January of 2014
//
//Performed by LunaMetrics http://www.lunametrics.com @lunametrics 
//and Sayf Sharif @sayfsharif
//With help as noted by additional coders of note and fame
//inline below whereupon their input was recieved
//
//Tis code not the most triumphant
//Nor that of most efficiency
//but neither is the field of poppies
//stretch'd ere the distance
//it matches its purpose
//

//CURTAIN
//
//Forsooth here doth we instantiate thy youtube player api 
//as it was written by the Google
var tag = document.createElement('script');
tag.src = "//www.youtube.com/iframe_api";
var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);
//Then as a drop of rain we create two heavenly arrays
//who may hold in thy endless bossom our value
//necessary they may be not, but what is love
//but the ample clevage of an array
var videoArray = new Array();
var playerArray = new Array();
//And a third, new to Part 3
//whereupon we now shall seek the title of our fair video
//with thanks to Alex Moore @almoo
//who is known by the Romanians
var videoTitle = new Array();
//and what is life without a magical switch
//for true we show the true title of the player
//unhindered by disguise or shadow
//for false we leave it obscured by darkness
//and the player id
//so rings the clock
//1 doth show the player title
//2 doth show the player id
//3 doth show both as concatenated by the hand of man
var showTitle = 3;
//and if you are not tracking
//even with this code
//try setting this line to 1
//for with it we force the youtube beast
//and reload the frames
//which oft works

//with hounds ere the dark of knight
//we sought them to blood our first array
